DSA:

**1. Linked List**  

     1. Reverse a Linked List
     2. Detect a Cycle in a Linked List
     3. Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
     4. Find the Middle of a Linked List
     5. Remove N-th Node From End of List
     6. Intersection of Two Linked Lists--- Write a program to determine the point of intersection of two linked lists.
     7. Check if a Linked List is a Palindrome
     8. Rearrange a Linked List---Given a linked list, rearrange it so that all odd-indexed nodes come before all even-indexed nodes
     9. Add Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists
     10. Clone a Linked List with Random Pointers---Given a doubly linked list where in addition to the next and previous pointers, each node may have a child pointer which may point to a separate doubly linked list, flatten the list.
     11. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Linked List
     12. Remove Duplicates from Unsorted Linked List
     13. Split a Linked List into Two Halves
     14. Find the Starting Node of the Cycle-----If a linked list has a cycle, return the node where the cycle begins.
