DSA:
---
1. solve leetcode problems on -
   Arrays
   **linked lists**
    1.  Reverse a Linked List
    2.  Detect a Cycle in a Linked List
    3.  Merge Two Sorted Linked List
    4. Find the Middle of a Linked List
    5. Remove N-th Node From End of List
    6.  Intersection of Two Linked Lists
    7. Check if a Linked List is a Palindrome
    8.  Rearrange a Linked List
         Given a linked list, rearrange it so that all odd-indexed nodes come before all even-indexed nodes
    9.  Add Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists
         Each node in a linked list represents a digit, and the digits are stored in reverse order. Write a function to sum two linked lists.
  10. Clone a Linked List with Random Pointers
         Given a linked list where each node has an additional random pointer, clone the list.
  11. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List
         Given a doubly linked list where in addition to the next and previous pointers, each node may have a child pointer which may point to a separate doubly linked list,             flatten the list.
  12. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Linked List
 ****  Graphs****
      1. 
   hash tables
   trees
   Sorting algorithms
   searching algorithms

Operating systems:
------------------

AI Tools:
---------
1. Experiment using open source LLMs to make a train and build a custom model
2. understand how configure and use agents for personal use
3. Automate tasks using AI (co-pilot, LLama etc.,)

Embedded AI:
